# mplus-hackathon

This is the entries of my team participating 2nd Hong Kong M+ Hackathon which is a visualization of m+ open data.

This is also the first attempt of me using three.js which written in pure javascript. 

If you want to give it a look. Just git clone it and open the index.html of the repository in browser.

Please give me any comment as I wanted to improve!
